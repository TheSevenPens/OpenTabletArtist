## Components

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

**Role:** The user-facing interface. Renders all UI, handles user interaction, manages client-side state.

**Technology:** Svelte 5 with Vite for development tooling.

**Key directories:**
- `src/lib/theme/` — CSS custom property system for dark/light modes and glassmorphism
- `src/lib/stores/` — Reactive state (Svelte 5 runes) for theme, connection, tablets, settings
- `src/lib/services/` — REST and WebSocket clients that communicate with the bridge
- `src/lib/components/` — Reusable UI components (layout shell, glass panels, area mapper)
- `src/lib/pages/` — Route-level page components (Dashboard, AreaMapping, etc.)
- `src/lib/types/` — TypeScript interfaces mirroring OTD data models

**Dependencies:** Svelte 5, Vite 8, TypeScript. No other runtime dependencies — the UI is built entirely from scratch using CSS custom properties and native SVG.

### Bridge (`bridge/`)

**Role:** A thin translation layer. Connects to the OTD daemon's named pipe, then re-exposes the daemon's capabilities as HTTP REST endpoints and a WebSocket for real-time events. The frontend never touches the named pipe directly.

**Technology:** .NET 8 minimal API with StreamJsonRpc.

**Key files:**
- `Program.cs` — HTTP server setup, endpoint routing, CORS, WebSocket handler
- `Services/DaemonClient.cs` — Named pipe client with automatic reconnection

**Dependencies:** StreamJsonRpc (v2.22.23, same version as the daemon).

**Why .NET?** The OTD daemon speaks StreamJsonRpc, which is a .NET library. While JSON-RPC is a language-agnostic protocol, using the same library ensures perfect wire compatibility without reverse-engineering the message framing (header-delimited JSON-RPC).

### OTD Daemon (external)

**Role:** The actual tablet driver. Manages USB/HID communication with tablet hardware, applies input processing (smoothing, area mapping, bindings), and exposes a configuration API over a named pipe.

**Interface:** `IDriverDaemon` — a JSON-RPC service on named pipe `"OpenTabletDriver.Daemon"`.

**Key operations:**
| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GetTablets()` | List connected tablets with specs |
| `GetSettings()` | Retrieve full configuration (profiles, bindings, filters) |
| `SetSettings(settings)` | Apply updated configuration |
| `GetApplicationInfo()` | Version, paths, directories |
| `DetectTablets()` | Trigger re-detection of hardware |

**Key events:** `TabletsChanged`, `DeviceReport`, `Message`, `Resynchronize`

This component is not part of our codebase. It is the standard OTD daemon, running unmodified.

### vmulti (Windows Virtual HID Driver)

**What it is:** A virtual HID miniport driver (originally by Djpnewton) that creates virtual input devices at the Windows kernel level. It injects HID reports directly into the input stack as if they came from real hardware.

**Why OTD needs it on Windows:** OTD's core input on Windows uses `SendInput()` for basic cursor positioning. However, `SendInput` cannot transmit pressure or tilt data. For artists who need pressure sensitivity and tilt in drawing applications, vmulti is **required**. It works alongside the Windows Ink plugin to create a virtual digitizer device that reports pressure and tilt through the Windows Ink API.

**The full artist setup on Windows requires:**
1. vmulti driver installed (enables the virtual HID device)
2. Windows Ink plugin installed within OTD
3. Output mode set to "Windows Ink Absolute Mode" (not the default "Absolute Mode")
4. Drawing application configured to use Windows Ink input

**Platform-specific input methods:**
- **Windows:** `SendInput()` for basic cursor + vmulti/Windows Ink for pressure and tilt
- **Linux:** libevdev/uinput — creates virtual devices named "OpenTabletDriver Virtual Tablet"
- **macOS:** Platform-specific CoreGraphics implementation

**Detecting vmulti:** The vmulti driver registers as a HID device with Vendor ID `0x00FF` (255) and Product ID `0xBACC` (47820). Detection is done by enumerating HID devices matching these IDs — if found, vmulti is installed. The VoiDPlugins source ([VMultiInstance.cs](https://github.com/X9VoiD/VoiDPlugins/blob/master/src/VoiDPlugins.Library/VMulti/VMultiInstance.cs)) shows the exact detection logic. The vmulti binary is distributed at [X9VoiD/vmulti-bin](https://github.com/X9VoiD/vmulti-bin/).

**Relevance to our prototype:** Since our target audience is creatives (not gamers), pressure and tilt are essential. Our UX should guide users through the vmulti + Windows Ink setup and surface clear status about whether these components are properly configured. See the [SevenPens OTD Windows install guide](https://docs.sevenpens.com/drawtab/guides/drivers/opentabletdriver/otd-windows-install) for the full artist workflow.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Web frontend instead of native UI

**Decision:** Use Svelte + Vite rather than WinUI3, Avalonia, or another native framework.

**Rationale:** The primary goal is fast iteration on visual design. Vite's hot module replacement gives sub-second feedback on CSS and component changes. The web platform's CSS capabilities (backdrop-filter, custom properties, transitions, SVG) provide the richest toolkit for the glassmorphism aesthetic. Native frameworks offer better system integration but slower build/reload cycles.

**Trade-off:** Requires a bridge process. Cannot directly call .NET APIs from the browser.

### 2. Separate bridge process instead of referencing OTD projects

**Decision:** The bridge defines its own slim DTO types and uses StreamJsonRpc as a generic JSON-RPC client. It does not reference `OpenTabletDriver.Desktop` or any other OTD project.

**Rationale:** Referencing `OpenTabletDriver.Desktop` would pull in transitive dependencies: `OpenTabletDriver.Native` (platform interop DLLs), `OpenTabletDriver.Configurations` (hundreds of tablet JSON files), the plugin system, Octokit, WaylandNET, and more. The bridge needs none of this — it only needs to call RPC methods and forward JSON. Keeping it decoupled makes the bridge tiny, fast to build, and free of native dependency issues.

**Trade-off:** DTO types must be kept in sync manually. If the daemon's data shapes change, the bridge DTOs need updating.

### 3. JSON passthrough in the bridge

**Decision:** The bridge uses `JsonElement` (opaque JSON) for most RPC return values rather than strongly-typed C# models.

**Rationale:** The frontend (TypeScript) is the real consumer of the data shapes. Deserializing into C# models only to re-serialize into JSON for HTTP is unnecessary work. Passing JSON through keeps the bridge minimal and avoids double-maintenance of type definitions.

### 4. Hash-based routing

**Decision:** Use `location.hash` for client-side routing (`#/`, `#/area`, `#/bindings`, etc.) with a simple `$state` variable, rather than a routing library.

**Rationale:** This is a single-page prototype with six pages. A routing library adds dependency weight and API surface for no benefit. Hash routing requires zero server configuration and works with any static file server.

### 5. CSS custom properties for theming

**Decision:** All colors, spacing, blur values, and glassmorphism parameters are CSS custom properties scoped to `[data-theme="dark"]` and `[data-theme="light"]` selectors.

**Rationale:** This allows instant theme switching with zero JavaScript re-rendering — only CSS values change. Components don't need to know which theme is active; they reference variables like `var(--glass-bg)` and the correct value resolves automatically.

## Technical Challenges

### Solved

**Svelte 5 runes in module-level stores.** `$effect()` cannot be called outside of a component rendering context. Module-level `.svelte.ts` files that use `$state` are fine, but `$effect` at the top level throws `effect_orphan`. Solved by using imperative side effects (direct DOM/localStorage calls) in store mutation methods instead of reactive effects.

**Named pipe message framing.** The OTD daemon uses the default `JsonRpc` constructor, which uses `NewLineDelimited` framing (not `HeaderDelimited`). The bridge must match this — using `new JsonRpc(stream)` directly.

**Newtonsoft.Json vs System.Text.Json.** StreamJsonRpc uses Newtonsoft.Json internally. The bridge cannot use `System.Text.Json.JsonElement` as the RPC return type — it must use `Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JToken` for JSON passthrough. Responses are serialized via `JToken.ToString()` into HTTP responses.

**PascalCase to camelCase normalization.** The OTD daemon sends JSON with PascalCase property names (e.g. `Profiles`, `OutputMode`). The frontend API service normalizes keys to camelCase to match TypeScript conventions.

**Cross-platform named pipes.** .NET's `NamedPipeClientStream` works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The pipe name `"OpenTabletDriver.Daemon"` is consistent across platforms. On Unix systems, the pipe maps to a Unix domain socket.

### Remaining

**Backdrop-filter performance.** Heavy `backdrop-filter: blur()` on multiple stacked glass panels can be GPU-intensive. Need to profile and potentially reduce blur layers or use static blurred backgrounds for deeply nested panels.

**SVG area mapper interaction.** The area mapping visualization currently renders static rectangles. Drag-to-move and handle-to-resize require pointer event handling with SVG coordinate transforms (screen space to viewBox space). This is non-trivial, especially with rotation.

**Daemon event subscription.** StreamJsonRpc supports event forwarding, but the bridge currently uses a simplified approach. Full bidirectional event wiring (where the bridge subscribes to daemon events via the RPC proxy's C# events) needs testing with the actual daemon.

**Settings write-back.** The UI can display settings but does not yet write changes back to the daemon. The `SetSettings` endpoint exists but the frontend forms are read-only placeholders.
